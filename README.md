# EnergySignature
This is the energy signature for the B3 building. 
A building energy signature is a diagram that represents the specific heat power in function of the temperature evolution over the year 2021 in this case. 
In order to generate this graph data of fuel consomation from Kevin Startor was used. In addition, the meteo file used was from Solcast.

The authors of this project are Leduc Charline and Baudru Anne-Sophie
